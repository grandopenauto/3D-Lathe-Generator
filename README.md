3D Lathe Generator
==============

A WebGL-based tool for drawing a shape and rotating it around an axis to create a lathed 3D object which can be downloaded as an STL.

Features include:

* **Draw and Edit a Shape** - The resulting shape then gets lathed around the z-axis. 
* **Preview** - 3D view of Lathed Shape that you can interact with
* **Change number of segments** - You can control how many sides the lathed shape has. Between 3 and 32. 
* **Reset** - Clear out existing shape and start over
* **Download .STL** - Get the lathed 3D object as a STL file which can be used for 3D printing.
